# PRODIGY_DS_02
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to understand passenger demographics and their survival rates through a series of data cleaning steps and visualizations. Key steps include handling missing values, converting data types, and generating descriptive statistics. The analysis highlights the relationships between variables such as passenger class, gender, and age to identify patterns and trends in the data.

The implementation utilizes popular libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization. By running the provided code, users can visualize the distribution of passengers by survival status, age distribution, and explore the survival rates across different classes and genders. This project serves as a valuable resource for those looking to gain insights from the Titanic dataset and can be further extended for more in-depth analysis.
